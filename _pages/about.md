## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I am **Jirui Dai (戴纪瑞)**, an 25 Fall Master's student in [Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/). Currently, I work as a Research Assistant in the [Cao Peng Group](https://yxy.njucm.edu.cn/2022/1026/c5740a108197/page.htm) at Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, advised by Postdoctoral Researcher **Zhi Liu**. My undergraduate research focuses on **large foundation models**—primarily large language models (LLMs)—for medical domain adaptation, aiming to leverage AI technology to overcome limitations in traditional Chinese medicine practice.  You can find my [Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV-Jirui DAI.pdf)
