## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I am **Jirui Dai (戴纪瑞)**, a Master’s student (Fall 2025 cohort) in [Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/).  
Currently, I am a Research Assistant in the [Cao Peng Group](https://yxy.njucm.edu.cn/2022/1026/c5740a108197/page.htm) at Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, advised by Postdoctoral Researcher **Zhi Liu**.  

My research interests broadly lie in **AI for healthcare**, where I focus on:
* Leveraging **large language models (LLMs)** and **multimodal AI** to tackle challenges in human health and medical practice.  
* Exploring **reinforcement learning (RL)** as a pathway to new LLM paradigms — investigating whether RL can push LLMs beyond alignment to achieve **self-consistent innovation**.  

I am also actively seeking collaboration with professors and researchers who share interests in medical AI, multimodal modeling, or RL for foundation models.  

You can find my CV [here](assets/CV-Jirui_DAI.pdf). CV information before 08/25/2025.

## 🧪 Ongoing & Upcoming Projects

### 1. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Inheritance  
<details>
<summary>🔎 Benchmark evaluation issues in applying LLMs to TCM knowledge transfer.</summary>
Currently focusing on benchmarking and evaluation challenges in adapting LLMs to traditional Chinese medicine knowledge inheritance and clinical adaptation.
</details>

### 2. Multimodal Dermatology AI  
<details>
<summary>🩺 Training image-to-text models for dermatological diagnosis.</summary>
Working on multimodal pipelines for skin disease recognition, currently focusing on image-to-text model training, with weekly progress updates in group meetings.
</details>

### 3. Gynecology-focused LLM  
<details>
<summary>⚕️ Small-scale LLM project for gynecology data.</summary>
Collecting gynecology-specific data. The project is designed as a lightweight adaptation, following methods from the TCM inheritance project.
</details>

### 4. TCM Clinical Experience Encoding  
<details>
<summary>📖 Applying physician experience datasets for a student’s thesis.</summary>
Providing the conceptual framework and guidance for a graduation project based on encoded physician work experience. Data is ready, project not yet started.
</details>

### 5. Long-Term TCM Integration Project  
<details>
<summary>⏳ 2–3 year project: bridging pharmacology and clinical practice.</summary>
A large-scale, multi-year effort to connect **TCM pharmacology** with **clinical applications** using LLMs. Currently in the data collection phase.
</details>

### 6. RL & Innovation in LLMs  
<details>
<summary>⚙️ Purely technical project exploring RL for LLM innovation.</summary>
Developing a **data-agnostic methodology** to test whether RL can enable LLMs to learn *new skills* by composing atomic operations, moving beyond human preference alignment.
