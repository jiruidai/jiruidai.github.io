I am **Jirui Dai (戴纪瑞)**, a Master’s student in [Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/).

Currently, I work as an **Assistant Researcher** (monthly stipend) in the [Cao Peng Group](https://yxy.njucm.edu.cn/2022/1026/c5740a108197/page.htm) at Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, advised by Postdoctoral Researcher **Zhi Liu**. I am also involved in collaborative research with multiple medical institutions (including **Peking Union Medical College Hospital**, **Dongfang Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine**, and **Gulou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Beijing**).
My interests sit at the intersection of **Medical AI** and **Reinforcement Learning**, with a focus on:
- **LLMs & multimodal models for clinical practice:** turning expert knowledge and real-world medical signals into reliable, usable systems.
- **RL for foundation models:** exploring whether reinforcement learning can expand model capabilities beyond “polite alignment” toward **broader, more reliable solution spaces**.
**I’m actively looking to collaborate** with researchers working on medical AI, multimodal learning, or RL for foundation models.
You can find my CV [here](/assets/CV-Jirui_Dai.pdf').CV information before 12/15/2025.

## Research Taste
I’ve become more optimistic about the possibility of **AGI** as I learn more about modern AI systems — and at the same time, more cautious about the **hype cycles** around them. Progress is real, but the trajectory is hard to forecast, and many “confident narratives” dissolve under stress testing.

Where I feel the most grounded optimism is **healthcare**. Medicine suffers from structural scarcity: limited expert time, uneven access, and high cognitive load. Carefully designed medical AI can help scale expertise, improve triage and documentation, and make high-quality guidance more accessible — as long as we treat evaluation, safety, and distribution shift as first-class citizens.

On the methods side, I have a persistent curiosity about **reinforcement learning**. RL is imperfect and sometimes unstable, but it captures something deeply human: in real life, better outcomes often require navigating a long chain of trade-offs, and the “reward” is rarely explicit. I suspect there exists a hidden structure of incentives that can guide foundation models toward a **wider subset of outputs** — richer strategies, more robust reasoning patterns, and more creative problem solving — instead of collapsing into a narrow, overly safe, overly similar response manifold.

By participating in more projects and gaining a deeper understanding of AI in the future, I will continuously improve my research skills and judgment.
