## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I am **Jirui Dai (戴纪瑞)**, a Master’s student in [Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/).  

Currently, I am a Research Assistant in the [Cao Peng Group](https://yxy.njucm.edu.cn/2022/1026/c5740a108197/page.htm) at Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, advised by Postdoctoral Researcher **Zhi Liu**.  
My research interests broadly lie in **AI for healthcare** and **Reinforcement Learning**, where I focus on:
* Leveraging **large language models (LLMs)** and **multimodal AI** to tackle challenges in human health and medical practice.  
* Exploring **reinforcement learning (RL)** as a pathway to new LLM paradigms — investigating whether RL can push LLMs beyond alignment to achieve **self-consistent innovation**.  

**I am also actively seeking collaboration with professors and researchers who share interests in medical AI or RL for foundation models.** 

You can find my CV [here](assets/CV-Jirui_DAI.pdf). CV information before 08/25/2025.
