Ongoing Projects (Only a portion is shown)
======
### 1. Compositional Reasoning for OOD Generalization (RL-based)
<details>
<summary>🧠 RL-driven compositional reasoning benchmark and evaluation under distribution shift.</summary>
A research project investigating whether reinforcement learning can improve LLMs’ compositional reasoning and generalization on out-of-distribution data. The scope unifies TCM Wenbing theory, herbal pharmacology, and KEGG pathway knowledge into a shared reasoning space, with an emphasis on structured data design and robustness-oriented evaluation.
</details>

### 2. Multimodal Dermatology Vision-Language Model for Psoriasis
<details>
<summary>🩺 VLM for psoriasis: single-image recognition and multi-image reasoning.</summary>
A multimodal vision-language modeling project for psoriasis, supporting both single-image recognition and multi-image reasoning. The project focuses on improving image–text alignment, producing structured clinical-style outputs, and designing evaluation protocols that remain stable under distribution shift.
</details>

### 3. Gynecology-focused LLM
<details>
<summary>⚕️ Small-scale LLM project for gynecology data.</summary>
Collecting gynecology-specific data. The project is designed as a lightweight adaptation, following methods from the TCM inheritance project.
</details>

### 4. TCM Clinical Experience Encoding
<details>
<summary>📖 Applying physician experience datasets for a student’s thesis.</summary>
Providing the conceptual framework and guidance for a graduation project based on encoded physician work experience. Data is ready, project not yet started.
</details>

### Long-Term TCM Integration Project
<details>
<summary>⏳ 2–3 year project: bridging pharmacology and clinical practice.</summary>
A large-scale, multi-year effort to connect TCM pharmacology with clinical applications using LLMs. Currently in the data collection phase.
